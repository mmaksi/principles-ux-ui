# Principles of UX/UI

## Week 1 - Introduction to UX/UI

### What is UX?

User Experience (UX) design is the process of designing and developing products, services, and systems that are easy to use, efficient, and satisfying for the people who use them. The goal of UX design is to create a positive and meaningful experience for users by understanding their needs, behaviors, and expectations. This involves a deep understanding of the user's context and task, as well as the product or service being designed. <br>

UX designers use a variety of techniques and methods, such as user research, user testing, usability testing, and user feedback, to gather data on how users interact with a product or service. This data is then used to inform the design of the product or service, with the goal of creating a user interface that is intuitive, efficient, and satisfying. <br>

UX design is an interdisciplinary field that draws on knowledge from fields such as psychology, human-computer interaction, graphic design, and industrial design. It's a holistic approach that considers not only the visual design but also the user's goals, task flow, and overall experience. <br>

Artifacts refer to the tangible or intangible products of the design process such as wireframes, mockups, user personas, user scenarios, and user stories. These artifacts are used to communicate design ideas, gather feedback, and evaluate the effectiveness of the design. They are also used to document the design process and decisions made during the development of a product or service. These artifacts can be shared and discussed with stakeholders, developers, and users to ensure that the final product meets the needs of its intended audience. They are valuable tools in the UX design process as they help to ensure that the design is user-centered and meets the goals and objectives of the project.

#### User personas

A user persona is a model or character that portrays a possible user of your website or app: their age group, sociometric position etc. User research is the first step in creating a user persona.

#### Conducting customer interviews

Interview at least five people. After conducting several interviews, you'll notice that you're getting very little or no new information. That means you don't need to interview any more users.

#### Making assumptions

If you've been working on a product for quite some time. You may have enough information to make reasonably accurate assumptions about your customers. Just make sure to back them up later with research.

#### Using web analytics

Web analytics tools are an excellent resource for quantitative data, so make the best of them. They can tell you how your customers behave but not why. You'll still need to talk to them to find out what motivates them.

#### Creating a customer persona group

Once your research is complete, you divide the information into customer persona groups which will then be consolidated into single-user personas, concentrating on the primary needs of the most important user group and one significant pain point.

#### User stories

As a (type of user), I want (a goal) for (some reason).

#### Scenarios

A scenario is a situation that depicts how users interact with your website or app. Scenarios describe the user's motivations for being there (their task or goal) and a question they need to be answered. They also suggest possible ways to achieve these goals. Scenarios are essentially an extension of the user story and can be applied to various target users. However, they can also be divided into use cases, which describe the sequence of tasks that any given user performs in a provided functionality or path.

#### Storyboards

A storyboard is a visual representation of how a user will interact with a product. Designers can create different storyboards: sketches, illustrations and screenshots, slideshows and animations, or live demos. <br>

Storyboarding is an excellent method for visually communicating design concepts to teams, stakeholders, and end users. Visualizing a design idea with an interactive storyboard, like high-fidelity prototypes closely resembling the final product, will help the audience remember, empathize, and connect with it.

#### Stages of UX Design

1. Empathize
2. Define
3. Ideate
4. Prototype
5. Test

### What is UI?

UI stands for User Interface. It refers to the way a user interacts with a computer program or application, such as the layout of buttons, menus, and other elements on a screen. It is the space where interactions between humans and a product or service occur. The goal of UI design is to make the user's interaction as simple and efficient as possible.
